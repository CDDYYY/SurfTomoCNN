# SurfTomo_CNN
This repository is used to store scripts and an example of surface tomography given real data set

# Configuration 

- You should install Pytorch 0.4 version and Anaconda3.4 and tensorboardX and basemap (for plotting Vs). 

`conda install pytorch=0.4.0 cuda90 -c pytorch; pip install tensorboardX;`

For basemap installation see https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html

All python scripts are py3.

# unzip the dataset

`cat Dataset.tar.gz.* | tar -zxv `

Training dataset: USA type (~7000 1-D Vs models from the USA (Shen et al., 2013)); USA-Tibet type (USA type + ~640 Tibet models)

Test dataset:    ~4000 pairs of disperion images associated with phase and group velocity (8-50s). (Shen et al., 2016)

# Two tests

- `scriptsUSA`: using only USA type training dataset to train and then using test dataset to predict 1-D Vs models

- `scriptsUSATibet`: using USA type plus ~640 Tibet models as training dataset and then using test dataset to predict 1-D Vs models

# How to run

For both tests, if you train again, run `Main_train.sh`. If you test, run `Main_test.sh`

The trained model at 600th epoch is included in `model_para`


# Plot vs

- `PlotVs` is used to make a comparison between cnn-based Vs models and results of Shen et al. (2016)

It would read `./scriptsUSA/vs_cnn and ./scriptsUSATibet/vs_cnn` as well as `./PlotVs/data/vs_sws_China` to plot
