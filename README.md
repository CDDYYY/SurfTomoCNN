# SurfTomo_CNN
This repository is used to store scripts and an example of surface tomography given real data set


# Configuration 
- You should install Pytorch 0.4 version and Anaconda3.4 and tensorboardX. 
`conda install pytorch=0.4.0 cuda90 -c pytorch; pip install tensorboardX` 
- All python scripts are python 3 version.
# unzip the dataset
`cat Dataset.tar.gz.* | tar -zxv `
# The example description
- Training dataset: ~7000 1-D Vs models from the USA (Shen et al., 2013)
- Test dataset:     ~4000 pairs of disperion images associated with phase and group velocity. (Shen et al., 2016)
